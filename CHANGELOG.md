# Changelog

All notable changes to PopStrip. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).
Every version lands on `main`; `main` is always the deployment target for [popstrip.app](https://popstrip.app).

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing pending — next up is v0.3.0 (color effects + the live effects grid)._

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-02 — The loop

### Added

- **Countdown** before the shutter (off / 3s / 5s / 10s, in the toolbar) with soft beeps and a big 3·2·1 over the live feed. Press **Esc** to cancel.
- **4-up mode** — the iconic Photo Booth burst: one countdown, then four rapid shots composed into a **2×2 quad**. Now the default; **Single** is still one tap away.
- **Photostrip composition** at print resolution (300 DPI) with a PopStrip footer + date — quad (4"×4.4"), vertical **strip** (2"×6"), and single. On the review screen a 4-up capture can switch between **▦ Grid** and **▤ Strip** layouts.
- **Redo a single shot** of a 4-up without starting over.
- **Bottom photo reel** — recent captures kept on-device (IndexedDB, capped); click one to reopen it, or remove it. Nothing is uploaded.
- **Confetti** celebration on capture (reduced-motion-safe).
- **Mirror toggle** in the toolbar.

### Changed

- Capture now flows through a shared frame → compose pipeline, so single, quad, and strip all share one code path (and video will slot into the same path later).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-02 — Skeleton

### Added

- Skeleton photo booth: live mirrored camera preview with device picker.
- Single-photo capture (button or Spacebar) with a reduced-motion-safe white flash and a synthesized shutter sound.
- Review screen with **Save** (folder via File System Access, or download), **Share** (Web Share), and **Copy** (clipboard).
- 90s-web interface with **Light & Dark** modes, persisted settings, and a privacy status line.
- Graceful fallback screen for every camera edge case (no camera, permission denied, camera in use, disconnected, unsupported browser, insecure context).
- Feature detection, `.htaccess` for DreamHost (SPA fallback, wasm MIME, caching), and a basic web app manifest.
